        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 450Â°F with a pizza stone in the bottom,if you're using one.</li>
            <li>In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the lukewarm water and yeast until the yeast dissolves.</li>
            <li>Measure out the flour by gently spooning it into a cup and sweeping off the excess; or by weighing it. Add the flour and the remaining ingredients to the water/yeast, stirring to make a cohesive, somewhat sticky dough. The dough should only be mildly sticky, and easy to work with. If it's sticking to your fingers, mix in additional flour.</li>
            <li>Divide the dough in half, pat each half into a disk, and place on a lightly floured piece of parchment or waxed paper. Let the dough rest for 30 minutes, while your oven gets good and hot.</li>
            <li>Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll between two pieces of lightly greased parchment. Roll a 12" circle; don't worry about making it perfectly round, an oval is fine. The rolled crust should be very thin.</li>
            <li>Top the crust with about 3 to 4 tablespoons sauce and your preferred toppings.</li>
            <li>Transfer the pizza, parchment and all, to your baking stone. Bake for about 8 minutes, until the crust is brown and the toppings are heated through. Remove from the oven and serve.</li>
            <li>If you're not using a stone, transfer the pizza, parchment and all, to a baking sheet. Bake in the center of the oven for 10 to 12 minutes, until the crust is brown and the toppings are cooked through. Remove from the oven and serve.</li><!--An ordered list defines a list of items in which the order of the items are matters.-->
