  <h1>Castlevania</h1>
	  <p>According to Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse, a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System in which Trevor Belmont plays the lead role, the events that took place in Wallachia in 1476 are the basis for the television series.  Konami published it in 1989 in Japan and 1990 in North America.  Palcom Software released it in Europe in 1992.</p>
	  <h3>Information about the tv show</h3>
	  <p>The show debuted on Netflix on July 7, 2017, and was renewed the same day for an expanded second season consisting of eight episodes, which premiered on October 26, 2018. Netflix later approved a ten-episode third season, which was released on March 5, 2020. The series concluded with its fourth season on May 13, 2021. It received widespread critical acclaim, earning praise for its visuals, animation, voice acting, action sequences, characters, themes, and writing.
