  <h1>Castlevania  Plot</h1>
	  <p>Castlevania takes place in 1400-1500s Europe. Just like in real life at that time, the Catholic church was corrupt and used religion to control others. This was easy to do because many people were illiterate, so the only information they had about what the bible said came from the Church.</p>
	  <p>Dracula is a centuries-old vampire who has scientific knowledge from all across the world, even from long-dead civilizations. Much of it has been forgotten by the time the story takes place.</p>
	  <p>Lisa visited Dracula's castle because she wanted to be a doctor and thinks Dracula's lost info can improve Wallachia's (Romania) poor knowledge of medicine. Dracula hates humans, but gives Lisa a chance and two later fall in love and marry. Lisa sends him to travel the world and learn about her species while she uses his books to cure people. However, this foreign medicine threatens the Church's power because it made people less dependent on God to heal their sicknesses.</p>
	  <p>Priest Guy (The Bishop) takes advantage of the fact that people cannot explain the ancient technology Lisa is using, and turns the people against her by saying she is using black magic given to her by Satan and has her burned as a witch while Dracula is out of town. Dracula is enraged his wife was murdered when all she wanted to do is help people, and he decides that humans are corrupt and need to be wiped off the planet.</p>
	  <p>Sypha is a member of the Speakers, nomadic scholars who sometimes practice magic. They prophesize that a magician, a monster hunter and a ''sleeping soldier'' will defeat Dracula and his army. Sypha goes looking for the Sleeping Soldier who supposedly lies under Greshit City but is captured by a monster. Her family stays to look for her. But because Speakers practice magic, the Bishop blames them for the night hordes he caused by killing Dracula's wife, and tries to have them killed by a mob.</p>
	  <p>Trevor Belmont happens to be passing by Greshit and learns of Sypha's disappearance and the plan by the Bishop to unleash the mob on the Speakers. Trevor's family was a group of monster hunters who protected Wallachia but were excommunicated (basically banished) from the Church because they learned a bit of magic from their encounters with the supernatural. Because of the Church they became hated by the people, forced into exile, and killed. This causes him to empathize with Speakers and he decides to save Sypha if the Speakers promise to leave Greshit. He finds Sypha in the catacombs beneath the city, but they get lost after falling through traps, and stumble upon a coffin they believe belongs to the Sleeping Soldier.</p>
	  <p>Adrian (Alucard) is who actually lies inside the casket. Son of Dracula and Lisa, he tried to stop his father from starting a genocide of humanity because it goes against his mother's wishes, but was defeated and hid himself underneath the city of Greshit to recover from his injuries. He is the one who the Speakers deemed the "sleeping soldier.'' He requests the help of Sypha and Trevor to help him kill his father.</p>
