  <h1>Castlevania  Reviews</h1>
	  <h4>A review for the season</h4>
	  <p>You know, I never imagined Netflix's Castlevania would turn out to be such a solid series back when the first season came out. Season 2 was phenomenal and Season 3 might be even better.

Taking place not long after the events of the last season, Castlevania Season 3 starts off strong with a focus on dialogue and character development which continues on for the majority of the episodes in a slower pace than what we've been used to before but justified and interesting since now there are several new characters, the world and lore is expanding (amazing worldbuilding), and the characters we know already getting further development (well-written and voice acted). There's also a lot of politics and scheming, kinda giving you early Game of Thrones vibes, and all of it was intriguing.

And while that's great and all, we are also treated to some truly magnificent fight sequences where the animators flex like crazy. And since the story grows and flows properly, those sequences become even more enthralling and thrilling aptly personifying the world 'Climax'.

On a technical level, it's a straight-up bump across the board. The art, the animation, the sound design, the soundtrack, all of it has been improved and I loved it.

It's hard to say whether I prefer season 2 over season 3 or the other way around because my favourite character is Dracula. But what I can safely say is that if you've enjoyed the previous two seasons, Season 3 will surely blow your mind. There's so much in it I didn't even expect or imagine that I'm purposefully being vague in order to not spoil anything. Watch it asap, I highly recommend it. And if I were to rate Season 3, I'd give it a 9/10.

P.S Trevor and Sypha are so cute together. And BADASS!</p>
	  <h4>A good show hindered by its budget
</h4>
	  <p>In four short episodes that amount to just over one and a half hour, Castlevania does a good job of introducing its basic plot and characters. Due to time constraints, this is all the first season does, and they couldn't have made a better decision. The atmosphere is great and the static backgrounds are a treat to the eyes. The biggest problem is in the animation. Often, movements are limited and stilted. The voice acting is great, but the almost static faces fail to live up to what the characters are saying. Hopefully, the creators will have a larger budget in season 2(the show has been renewed for 8 new episodes), and will address the technical issues that prevent Castlevania from being as thrilling as it should,</p>
	  <h4>A show you can really stick your teeth into</h4>
	  <p>This isn't the first animated project based on a video game series and certainly won't be the last, but it's by far the most memorable and most well executed.

Castlevania does what so many fail to do, they keep it simple yet entertaining. Regardless on if you have played the games or know nothing about the lore, the show makes it easy for newcomers to understand the and engage with the plot, while keeping things original and fun with the fans.

The voice acting is superb and the soundtrack is splendid, but where this show really shines is its graphic and beautiful action scenes and cinematic animation.

Whether you are a longtime fan of the Castlevania games, love anything Vampire/Supernatural or enjoy a good anime this is the show for you. The series starts off strong in the first season and has a satisfying ending that while may not suit everyone makes you feel like the entire journey was worth it. Would highly recommend.</p>
